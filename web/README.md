# ReactJS Template

"Inspired" from [GitHub](https://github.com/issaafalkattan/React-Landing-Page-Template)

## Install and Run

1. **Node.js LTS (16.15.0) is required**, it won't work with (18.1.0)
    - To install multiple versions of Node.js, see [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (stackoverflow helped alot).
2. Install dependencies:
    - `yarn` or `yarn install` or `npm install`
        - All 3 works, however, `yarn` is recommended.
 3. Run:
    - `yarn start` or `npm install`
